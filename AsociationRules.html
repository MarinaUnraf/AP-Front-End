a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in
the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
field may be required to play all their games away.
